# Tens-Game1
Hi! Welcome! This is my Java game simulating the card game known as "Tens"

Uses the power of JPanels and JOptionpanes to handle the GUI aspect of the game!

-Java needed to run the program

-All images used are as shown in the directory

-Not all of the images were able to be uploaded, so please download the cards1 folder from Tens-Game2 repository and merge it into the cards2 folder in this repository
  
-Name this new folder: cards

-The poker cards are based off of Nintendo's Splatoon game!

Feel free to use the below link to access an executable jar file of the program. Thanks!
